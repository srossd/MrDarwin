[19:04:31] <epicksl> 2How do you do that?
[19:04:31] <tkamath2> what does that mean???
[19:04:47] <srossd> s shell and p shell
[19:04:53] <srossd> and multiple energy levels
[19:04:58] <epicksl> 2What are the s and p shells?
[19:05:03] <srossd> each energy level
[19:05:04] <srossd> 1-7
[19:05:06] <tkamath2> 1st and second shells
[19:05:07] <tkamath2> yea
[19:05:08] <srossd> (one for each period)
[19:05:08] <tkamath2> but
[19:05:12] <tkamath2> i was taught
[19:05:12] <srossd> and then in each one
[19:05:12] <tkamath2> that 
[19:05:19] <srossd> you have suborbitals
[19:05:19] <tkamath2> thats a stupid way of doing it
[19:05:25] <srossd> why?
[19:05:29] <tkamath2> no
[19:05:31] <tkamath2> i was taught that
[19:05:34] <tkamath2> in 6th grade
[19:05:38] <tkamath2> read earlier
[19:05:55] <srossd> what do you mean?
[19:06:01] <epicksl> 2I doubt they taught you that in 6th grade :|
[19:06:05] <tkamath2> they did
[19:06:07] <epicksl> 2It was probably something simpler
[19:06:11] <srossd> like 2, 6
[19:06:12] <tkamath2> no
[19:06:15] <tkamath2> im sure they did
[19:06:17] <tkamath2> -.-
[19:06:19] <srossd> see, the problem with that
[19:06:25] <srossd> is in the transition metals
[19:06:26] <tkamath2> no
[19:06:29] <tkamath2> im serious
[19:06:33] <tkamath2> im serious bro
[19:06:36] <srossd> so am i
[19:06:37] <tkamath2> and when i did 2, 6
[19:06:40] <tkamath2> i meant
[19:06:43] <tkamath2> 2 in the p shell
[19:06:46] <tkamath2> 6 in the s shell
[19:06:48] <srossd> i know what you meant
[19:06:52] <tkamath2> then?
[19:07:02] <epicksl> 2That's not the full configuration
[19:07:05] <srossd> and by the way
[19:07:06] <tkamath2> fine
[19:07:06] <srossd> yeah
[19:07:10] <srossd> thats not right to begin with
[19:07:12] <srossd> buuuut
[19:07:14] <tkamath2> lets just move on
[19:07:24] <srossd> s, p, d, and f dont stick together
[19:07:26] <tkamath2> fine
[19:07:29] <tkamath2> lets just continue
[19:07:33] <tkamath2> goddamnit
[19:07:33] <srossd> only the outer shells are important, for one

[19:28:16] <epicksl> 2He's running the server on his computer

[19:31:32] <epicksl> 2good job xD
[19:31:42] <srossd> we should do the whole tournament like this
[19:31:46] <epicksl> 2I am an extremely slow reader >.<
[19:31:51] <epicksl> 2So I wouldn't get anything :P
[19:31:59] <srossd> i wish i could do it like the qb people
[19:32:03] <srossd> they have it go line by line
[19:32:06] <srossd> kinda like spreeder
[19:32:13] <epicksl> 2Oh
[19:32:13] <epicksl> 2Yeah
[19:32:17] <epicksl> 2Then that would be more even
[19:32:23] <epicksl> 2Because the choices would come one at a time
[19:32:24] <srossd> maybe i should dev that up
[19:32:26] <srossd> but its in tcl
[19:32:31] <srossd> which is really really ugly
[19:32:42] <epicksl> 2Ask the Kealing people for their stuff?
[19:32:52] <srossd> their bot came preprepared
[19:32:55] <srossd> with questions and all
[19:32:58] <srossd> so i couldnt adapt it
[19:33:08] <srossd> well, maybe i could
[19:33:11] <srossd> but they also seem clueless
[19:33:12] <srossd> so
[19:33:13] <srossd> yeah
[19:33:21] <epicksl> 2xD
[19:33:23] <epicksl> 2Ok
[19:33:28] <epicksl> 2Well
[19:33:44] <epicksl> 2What ever happened to the moderator program?
[19:33:50] <srossd> what?
[19:33:50] <epicksl> 2That spoke to you?
[19:33:57] <srossd> oh, oh
[19:34:07] <srossd> well, i couldnt make it an applet
[19:34:13] <srossd> because of problems with the tts
[19:34:25] <epicksl> 2D:
[19:34:27] <srossd> so it was kinda useless
[19:34:33] <srossd> i guess i should try again
[19:34:39] <epicksl> 2If we could add more questions to Zatobowl
[19:34:41] <epicksl> 2That would be good
[19:34:46] <srossd> yeah
[19:34:47] <epicksl> 2And get rid of the constant freezing
[19:34:50] <srossd> and if it could read a bit better
[19:34:53] <srossd> and that too
[19:34:58] <epicksl> 2Robot voice >.<
[19:35:06] <srossd> worse than that
[19:35:10] <epicksl> 2Errrrth Si-ents
[19:35:19] <epicksl> 2Mooltipl Choys
[19:35:36] <srossd> or CS questions
[19:35:38] <srossd> those are just funny
[19:35:39] <epicksl> 2God, that voice annoys me :-/
[19:35:44] <srossd> yeah
[19:36:21] <epicksl> 2Random Question: What exactly do we do for that Latin city thing?
[19:36:25] <epicksl> 2I wasn't at Latin yesterday
[19:36:33] <srossd> just draw all those buildings in a city layout
[19:36:40] <srossd> i just made it an ancient NYC
[19:37:05] <epicksl> 2Do we title/label the buildings?
[19:37:10] <srossd> yeah
[19:37:30] <epicksl> 2Do we need to give them special names?
[19:37:34] <srossd> nope
[19:37:37] <epicksl> 2Ok
[19:37:39] <srossd> brb
[19:37:41] <epicksl> 2Simple enough
[19:37:48] <epicksl> 2Brb, too
[19:37:53] <epicksl> 2Jeopardy + Snack
[19:52:02] <srossd> ok

[20:00:52] <epicksl> 2:o
[20:00:53] <epicksl> 2Back
[20:00:53] <epicksl> 2xD
[20:00:59] <epicksl> 2Weird final jeopardy :-/
[20:02:45] <epicksl> 2ooooooohhhh
[20:02:53] <epicksl> 2I'm stupid >.<
[20:02:57] <epicksl> 2I didn't hear the solution to it
[20:03:02] <epicksl> 2But now I get it :-/
[20:03:03] <epicksl> 2I thin
[20:03:06] <epicksl> 2*think
[20:12:27] <srossd> what was it?
[20:12:41] <epicksl> 2Like
[20:13:17] <epicksl> 2Newton was the leader of the Royal Academy of Science in London, but his rival was head of the academy in this capitol city
[20:13:42] <srossd> leibniz...berlin?
[20:13:59] <epicksl> 2Yeah
[20:14:15] <epicksl> 2I was just, like
[20:14:35] <epicksl> 2There were probably a bunch of angry French people back then
[20:14:41] <srossd> haha
[20:14:44] <epicksl> 2With views opposite that of Newton's
[20:14:49] <epicksl> 2So derrrp, it's Paris :D
[20:15:26] <epicksl> 2I guess I can close this?
[20:15:35] <srossd> yeah, i guess so
[20:15:41] <srossd> tarun must be dead
[20:15:43] <epicksl> 2Alright
[20:15:43] <epicksl> 2Bye

[21:00:26] <Ross> Oh
[21:00:29] <Ross> Wait
[21:00:35] <Ross> Can you quiz me on counting? >.<
[21:00:47] <srossd> ok then
[21:00:53] <Ross> I kind of fail at counting and probability
[21:00:56] <srossd> 7 choose 3
[21:01:09] <Ross> 21
[21:01:10] <Ross> ?
[21:01:13] <Ross> Nope
[21:01:14] <srossd> 35
[21:01:19] <Ross> Yeah
[21:01:35] <srossd> Orders of a table of 5 people
[21:01:39] <srossd> brb
[21:01:41] <Ross> 120
[21:01:47] <srossd> table
[21:01:53] <Ross> 60?
[21:05:00] <Ross> When do you divide the stuff by two?
[21:05:04] <Ross> Would this be 24 or 12?
[21:11:58] <srossd> it would be 24
[21:12:05] <srossd> since we dont care about guy #1
[21:12:21] <Ross> Ok
[21:12:25] <Ross> When would we divide by 2?
[21:12:31] <srossd> If it's flippable.
[21:12:37] <srossd> Tables of people are not flippable.
[21:12:41] <srossd> But keychains are.
[21:12:49] <Ross> Wouldn't flipping multiply by two?
[21:13:06] <Ross> That's what it would seem like...
[21:13:15] <srossd> But the cases aren't distinct.
[21:13:22] <srossd> So you have to divide, since you double counted.
[21:13:28] <Ross> Oh
[21:13:29] <Ross> I see
[21:14:32] <srossd> just resetting so we can use it tomorrow
[21:15:00] <Ross> When tomorrow?
[21:15:12] <srossd> when we get to our cozy little lounge
[21:15:19] <srossd> maybe we can play some
[21:15:30] <srossd> but no partyline, so it will be kinda tough
[21:16:10] <Ross> Can't we just do it verbally? xD
[21:16:23] <srossd> we could, but that's too mainstream.
[21:16:29] <Ross> True...
[21:16:47] <srossd> of course, we probably will end up doing that.
